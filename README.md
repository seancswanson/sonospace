# Sonospace
A beautiful, minimal, and funky redesign of the Spotify Web Player. Use **Sonospace** to boogie down, browse new releases, and to review playlists! Growing up in an era that celebrated custom media players Ã  la Fubar, WinAmp, etc, I have been missing custom skins on the programs that I use the most... so I decided to make one from scratch! Thank you for visiting this repo!

### User Stories

> As a user, I want to be able to log in through Spotify or be linked to Spotify for account creation.
> As a user, I want to be able to view the song currently playing, browse new music from top artists, and review playlists.

### Versioning

> As of **February 18, 2018** this app is in development post-graduation from General Assembly's WDI program and is initilized in this GitHub repo. Basic React Routes stubbed out and design of the UI has begun.
 

## To Do

As this is a project currently in development, there some things left to implement.

> Render top artists/new released album art in media player.
> Change interval for the getCurrentSong functionality to avoid polling Spotify too often.
> Fetch user's public AND private playlists.
> Incorporate 30 second preview files for any song clicked on from the client.
> DJ function, create playlists based on interests.
